          In the digital age, bots and automated scripts are increasingly used
          by fraudsters to manipulate systems, exploit vulnerabilities, and
          commit large-scale fraud. Detecting and preventing such activities is
          critical for securing online platforms, protecting users, and
          safeguarding financial transactions.

          What Are Bots and Automated Attacks?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Bots are software programs that automate repetitive tasks. While some
          bots (like search engine crawlers) serve legitimate purposes, malicious
          bots are used to perform harmful activities at scale. Automated attacks
          allow fraudsters to exploit weaknesses much faster than humans can.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <b>Credential Stuffing:</b> Using stolen usernames and passwords to
            gain unauthorized access.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Fake Account Creation:</b> Opening multiple accounts for fraud or
            abuse of promotions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Web Scraping:</b> Extracting sensitive or competitive information.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If bots and automated activities go undetected, organizations face
          significant risks including financial loss, reputational damage, and
          operational disruption. Detecting them in real-time ensures trust,
          safety, and compliance.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <b>E-Commerce:</b> Bots buy limited edition products (like sneakers

            prices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Banking:</b> Fraudsters use bots to test thousands of stolen
            credit card numbers to find active ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Social Media:</b> Bots spread fake news, generate likes, or post
            spam comments automatically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Gaming:</b> Automated bots gain unfair advantages by farming
            resources or hacking leaderboards.
